          <h2>Confidence doesn't help win the lottery</h2> 
          <p>It doesn’t matter how sure you are that this is a winning ticket, the ticket doesn’t care.</p>
          <p>And there are lots of lotteries in our lives.</p>
          <p>I was talking to a fifteen-year old the other day. He’s decided to devote the next decade of his life to getting drafted to play in the NBA.</p>
          <p>Without a doubt, effort and skill make a huge impact on whether you’ll even make the final 5,000 people who have a shot at making the NBA. But after that, it looks a lot more like a lottery than a meritocracy.</p>
          <p>The resilient approach is to bring discipline and effort to the work, but to know, deep down, that you better have a plan B. That’s not a lack of faith. That’s simply smart.</p>

          <h2>Accounting (and small business)</h2> 
          <p>Every small business needs a bookkeeper, but few take appropriate advantage of accounting.</p>
          <p>Accounting is a way to turn organized books into insight. Particularly:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>It can help us make decisions.</strong> Any data that isn’t going to help you make a decision is worth ignoring. More granularity isn’t better granularity.</li>
            <li><strong>It can help us understand our cash flows.</strong> In any given moment, we know very little about a business. But over time, we can see how assets and expenses flow–and that flow is insight about what we own, what it’s worth and what could improve (see #1.)</li>
            <li><strong>It can implement systems that build trust.</strong> When we know who is spending what and when and why, it’s easier stop micromanaging and focus on #1 instead.</li>
            <li><strong>We can get better at predicting the future.</strong> Budgets based on past experiences are more likely to be accurate than those we simply make up in the moment.</li>
          </ol>
